Source codes that use the BottlePy framework with Python for the Internet

I used to teach basic computer programming and web programming using the Python 3 language. To enable web development with ease, I used the BottlePy framework that is very easy to use. I have included the bottle.py source code that is also available with the main website of BottlePy.

To use this program, do the following.

1. Download all source code in a directory or folder.
2. Open a terminal or a powershell and check if you have Python 3 installed in your system. If you do, great! If you do not, go to http://www.python.org to know how to install that in your system.
3. Get in the directory where you have downloaded the source codes and run the bottle_example1.py script. I assume that your Python 3 is called python3, and you do this:

python3 bottle_example1.py

It will not give you back the cursor and you will see a bit of info about the running code.

4. Open a web browser like Firefox and open the bottle_example1.html to see a basic web page with a URL.
5. Click the link and it will send the request to the waiting web server. See the exchange in the terminal.
